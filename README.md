üéØ Requirements:-These are main objectives of this project

1. Total Sales Analysis:

‚Ä¢ Calculate the total sales for each respective month.

‚Ä¢ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales.

‚Ä¢ Calculate the difference in sales between the selected month and the previous month.

2. Total Orders Analysis:

‚Ä¢ Calculate the total number of orders for each respective month.

‚Ä¢ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the number of orders.

‚Ä¢ Calculate the difference in the number of orders between the selected month and the previous month,

3. Total Quantity Sold Analysis:

‚Ä¢ Calculate the total quantity sold for each respective month.

‚Ä¢ Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the total quantity sold.

Calculate the difference in the total quantity sold between the selected month and the previous month.

4. Calendar Heat Map:
5. 
‚Ä¢ Implement a calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month from a slicer

‚Ä¢ Each day on the calendar will be color-coded to represent sales volume, with darker shades indicating sales.

‚Ä¢ Implement tooltips to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific

5. Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends:

‚Ä¢ Segment sales data into weekdays and weekends to analyze performance variations.

‚Ä¢ Provide insights into whether sales patterns differ significantly between weekdays and weekends.

6. Sales Analysis by Store Location:

‚Ä¢ Visualize sales data by different store locations.

‚Ä¢ Include month-over-month (MoM) difference metrics based on the selected month in the slicer.

Highlight MoM sales increase or decrease for each store location to identify trends.

. Daily Sales Analysis with Average Line:

‚Ä¢ Display daily sales for the selected month with a line chart.

‚Ä¢ Incorporate an average line on the chart to represent the average daily sales.

‚Ä¢ Highlight bars exceeding or falling below the average sales to identify exceptional sales days.

7. Sales Analysis by Product Category:

‚Ä¢ Analyze sales performance across different product categories.

‚Ä¢ Provide insights into which product categories contribute the most to overall sales.

8. Top 10 Products by Sales:

‚Ä¢ Identify and display the top 10 products based on sales volume.

‚Ä¢ Allow users to quickly visualize the best-performing products in terms of sales.

9. Sales Analysis by Days and Hours:

‚Ä¢ Utilize a heat map to visualize sales patterns by days and hours.

Implement tooltips to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific day hour.

And to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPI`s and visualization.

üìÅ Data Source:-The raw data for this project was obtained in the form of a CSV file with 15 columns and approximately 14.3k rows .The data contained information about coffee sales data,branch location etc. And data contained only six month from January 2023 to June 2023.

‚öí Data Processing and Cleaning :- Several steps were taken to prepare data for analysis are as follows .

‚óæ Null and Duplicates values were eliminated.

‚óæ Spelling errors were identified and corrected, appropriate datatypes were assigned.

üîë Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):-For analysis ,I have identified 

KPIs to track and monitor sales performance  .The following KPIs were created visualizations in Power Bi :

‚óæ Total sales of selected month and growth rate respectively previous month and sales difference respectively previous month

‚óæ Total orders of selected month and growth rate respectively previous month and sales difference respectively previous month.

‚óæ Total quantities sold out of selected month and growth rate respectively previous month and sales difference respectively previous month.

üìä Charts and Insights :- I have used several charts and visualizations to gain insights from the patients data .Here some of the key insights gained from the analysis.

‚óæ Clustered bar chart :The chart showed total sales by each product category.

‚óæ Clustered bar chart :The chart showed total sales by top 10 sold out  product type.

‚óæStacked Column chart :Showed sales trend by period its displayed daily sales and also showed which sale day is more than average sale or not .

‚óæ Clustered bar chart :The chart  showed total sales by store location.

Conclusion: 

This coffee sales data showed that June 2023 is most selling out month in which month $166k number of total sales ,35k total orders and  more than 50k quantities sold out.

Thursday and Friday are most selling days in whole month, bacause sales on thursday is $27k and on friday is $28k.

 In whole June 2023 month the hour no from 6 to 10 are most sellling hours.

The most selling product category is Coffee and most selling product type is Barista Espresso.

The most growth decreasing month is February 2023.

From this most important insights organization can take better decisions and can increase the sales and growth of business, and can address any issues. ü§ó
